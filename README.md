# Brutalist-Minimalist Theme

[Brutalist-Minimalist][bm] is a [Hugo][] theme inspired by [David
Copeland's][copeland] [manifesto on brutalist web design][brutalist
web design]: Web "content true to its construction".

The idea here -- being true to the construction or materials -- is not
to be confused with the [trend to ugly and/or intentionally unusable
design][the ugly trend] (I heard, that trend is dead, but on the other
side there are [some rumours][revival rumours]).

What the [Brutalist-Minimalist][bm] theme tries to achieve is:

- Minimal styling for content that would also be readable without any styling.
- Responsivity.
- Math integration via KaTeX.
- A printing style that looks more like a printed article than like an image of a web site.
